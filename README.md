# Vehicle-congestion-density-Traffic-control-system
With increased development in productivity of the Automobile Industry, The number of 
vehicles on roadway systems has / is gone higher , which as a result has led to traffic 
Congestion in almost all urbanized geography whose dire Consequence is rising 
significantly day by day. The intimate methodology to surmount the premise is to 
efficiently handle the departure period at the traffic junction.
Our team here proposes the effective handling of departure period based on application 
of Digital Image processing based Vehicle Congestive Density dependent Adaptive Traffic 
Control Signal.
It is used to maintain the traffic light according to the  density of the vehicle in particular lane
here we use the one image as the reference and compare the image that have been take from the road lanes.
we will see that how many pixels have been fill in the taken image from the reference image to make image matching.
Here we are using canny edge detection.
